# Tailwind CSS Configuration Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tailwind CSS configuration where styles fail to apply due to incorrect file path specifications in the `tailwind.config.js` file. The problem arises when the `content` array within the configuration doesn't accurately reflect the locations of your template files, thus preventing Tailwind from processing them correctly.

## Bug Description

The bug is characterized by the absence of any Tailwind CSS styles in the project despite having the framework properly installed and configured (or so it seems).

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js` file correctly points to all the files and/or directories where Tailwind classes are used.  This might involve adjusting the paths or adding missing entries to ensure complete style coverage.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server (if applicable).
4. Observe that Tailwind CSS styles are missing from the rendered HTML, highlighting the bug.

## How to fix

Refer to the `bugSolution.js` for the corrected `tailwind.config.js` file.  Pay close attention to the updated `content` array.  The key is to accurately list all the locations where Tailwind CSS classes are utilized in your project.
